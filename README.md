# Scraping_Shunshine_info
In this project, I  scraped sunshine data from wikipedia using R-vest package.
The link to the data can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_by_sunshine_duration which depicts 
the list of cities by sunshine duration.
Data exist in html format. I harvested the data using R-vest and converted into dataframe after which I did a simple visualization.
